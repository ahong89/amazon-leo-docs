# Intro
This is a document which contains all the current guidelines for contributing to the **Amazon Leo
Team** with App Dev Club. It is subject to change over the course of the semester and everyone is
highly encouraged to reference the document as needed.

Excerpt from the PEP 8 style guide (Guido is the creator of python):
> One of Guido’s key insights is that code is read much more often than it is written. The
> guidelines provided here are intended to improve the readability of code and make it consistent
> across the wide spectrum of Python code. As PEP 20 says, “Readability counts”.

> A style guide is about consistency. Consistency with this style guide is important.
> Consistency within a project is more important. Consistency within one module or function
> is the most important.

> However, know when to be inconsistent – sometimes style guide recommendations just aren’t
> applicable. When in doubt, use your best judgment. Look at other examples and decide what
> looks best. And don’t hesitate to ask!
