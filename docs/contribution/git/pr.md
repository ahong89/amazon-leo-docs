# Pull Request / Code Reviews
When making a PR, required details:
- Changes to dependencies and purpose for example:
```
Axios: added for making requests to backend
```
- Any known issues
- If feature has complicated implementation that has not been discussed, overview of functionality

Before making a PR, always merge with main prior and test, it is the individual developer’s
responsibility to stay up to date with main and deal with merge conflicts with their features.

## Distributed Code Reviews
A change from last semester is that code reviews are now done by every engineer on the team.
Every PR will need to be approved by 1-2 engineers before it gets merged into the main branch.
This ensures that at least one other person has looked through the changes and has ensured that
the code is organized in a sensible way and follows good practices. 

The reviewers will leave comments which will need to be fixed by the engineer who originally made
the PR. After all comments are addressed and the PR is approved, the PR can be merged in.
