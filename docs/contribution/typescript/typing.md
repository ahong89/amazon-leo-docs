# Typing
Since we are using typescript and there are many language features there are a number of standards to set in
how things should be typed.

It is worth noting the verbage on some of these standards. Never/always should be followed however the usage of
"preferred" or "rarely" means decisions are up to the programmer and should take some consideration. If a
bad-practice of typing is required than it should be denoted in a PR description.

## 1. Assertions
Rarely use ‘as’ assertation, it just silences the compiler instead use an if statement to do type assertation.
```typescript
if (!(x instance of Foo)) throw new Error('bad type');
```

## 2. Typing records
Always use ‘:’ as opposed to ‘as’ for records, this is because typescript compiler does not enforce type
checking over records with ‘as’.
```typescript
const foo = {
  bar: 123,
  bam: 'abc',  // bad!
} as Foo;

const foo: Foo = {
  bar: 123,
  bam: 'abc',  // good! Will throw error if wrong
};
```

Always use interfaces over the type alias for consistency. They are the same however we must pick one :)
```typescript
interface User { // good!
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

type User = { // bad!
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
}
```

## 3. General typing practice
Never use ‘any’ unless there is a specific reason which should always be documented with a comment and
in the git PR, consider using unknown if appropriate.  

Never use wrapper types. (i.e. String, Boolean, Number)  

Always use strict equality `===` & `!==` to avoid unexpected bugs, unless there is supposed to be type
flexibility (which shouldn't happen very often or at all).
