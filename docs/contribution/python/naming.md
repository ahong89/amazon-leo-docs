# Naming

## Conventions
Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, files and folders.  
Use `UpperCamelCase` for classes.  
Use `CAPITAL_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.  
Use `_leading_snake_case` for private class members.  

## Abbreviations
Always treat abbreviations like words.

```python
load_http_url = "url here"  # good
load_HTTP_URL = "url here"  # avoid
```
